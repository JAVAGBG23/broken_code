### Fix the broken code!

This repo contains code that is broken by purpose for you to fix it :) 
The code can contain both errors and logical errors so once you get the server up and running you need to test all routes in Postman.

How to start the server (hopefully...):
1. clone the repo
2. open the porject in VSCode
3. open the terminal and run **npm install**
4. start the server with **npm run dev**
